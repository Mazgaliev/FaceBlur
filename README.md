# FaceBlur
Small project that uses python open CV to live blur the face of a person
It is not very optimised so it might be a bit slow with low fps to achieve the possible blurring.
It uses a already trained haar_cascade_FrontalFaceclassificator so it is good at blurring faces looking directly at the camera, otherwise not so much.
Face detection can be optimised using deep learning algorithms.
